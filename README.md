## Domain of Interest - Movies and TV Shows on Various Streaming Platforms

- Our group is intrigued by this domain because watching movies and tv shows is a common interest, especially now that we are quarantined at home. Analyzing how streaming platforms and their users may have changed during the pandemic may provide insight into how we have adjusted to life in isolation. Furthermore, we may reveal general trends about how streaming services have improved and adjusted overtime to increase subscriptions and revenue.
- Other examples of data-driven projects related to this domain:
    - The [Netflix Consumption Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/sahib12/netflix-consumption-analysis) project included analysis on the most preferable movie length and which countries had the most exclusive content.
    - The [What to Watch Next](https://www.kaggle.com/vishynair/what-to-watch-next-analysis-of-amazon-prime-shows/notebook) project attempts to find shows to binge on Amazon Prime based on different factors (ex: number of seasons, ratings, etc).  
    - The [Netflix Visualizations, Recommendation, EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/niharika41298/netflix-visualizations-recommendation-eda/notebook) project studied which month of the year a producer should release content, in addition to other content related topics.
- Data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain include:
    - What are the user demographics of various streaming platforms? How have they changed over time?
    - What genres are most popular on each streaming platform? (Do these align with other streaming platforms?)
    - How have the duration, ratings, viewers, and genres of tv shows and movies on various streaming platforms changed in 2020 (due to quarantine)?
